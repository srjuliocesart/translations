# Sorting properties

Hi there!

Well as we known PHP doesn't really uses .properties the one similar to it in the language would be the .ini 
but the test was to make it work parsing the resource.properties and sorting the translations alphabetically (
enjoy it, go crazy with the properties file, do whatever you want).

To make it work it's very simple, you should just open your terminal in the root directory of the project
and use the command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After doing it you should access in your browser:

```
localhost:9000
```

And after do it you can access the ordered-resource.properties in the *pub/* project folder.

*Pin point here* I know that searching in file sometimes sucks a little so I've decided to create an achor to download a *txt*
of the file, hope that this helps to not get bored to see a blank page.
